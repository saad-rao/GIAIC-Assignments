**GIAIC Assignments** <br/><br/>
This repository contains all of my GIAIC assignments(Governor initiative of artificial intelligence and computing). In these assignments, I worked with current web technologies, particularly TypeScript, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.

**Technologies Used**:<br/>
*TypeScript*: is a superset of JavaScript that introduces static typing to the language, improving code quality and maintainability.<br/>
*Next.js*: A strong React framework that includes server-side rendering, static site generation, and routing functionality out of the box.<br/>
*Tailwind CSS*: is a utility-first CSS framework that enables quick UI creation by incorporating pre-defined utility classes straight into the HTML structure.<br/>

**Project Overview**:<br/>
In this repository, I will submit all of my GIAIC-related assignments. The tasks demonstrate numerous concepts and solutions in artificial intelligence and web development.Each project aims to solve real-world problems with the tools and technology indicated above.

**Skills Enhanced**:
*Web Development*: I improved my full-stack development skills with Next.js.<br/>
*CSS Styling*: I've mastered Tailwind CSS for responsive and configurable user interfaces.<br/>
*TypeScript*: Learned TypeScript to build more robust and scalable applications.<br/>

**Contribution**:<br/>
